      <h2>What's the difference between weather and climate?</a></h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people say "weather is what you get" and "climate is what you expect." "Weather" refers to the more local changes in the climate we see around us, on short timescales from minutes to hours to days to weeks. Examples are familiar - rain, snow, clouds, winds, thunderstorms, heat waves and floods. "Climate" refers to longer-term averages (they may be regional or global), and can be thought of as the weather averaged over several seasons, years or decades. Climate change is harder for us to get a sense of because the timescales involved are much longer, and the impact of climate changes can be less immediate. Examples of climate change include several drier-than-normal summers, a trend of, say, winters becoming milder from our grandparents' childhood to our own, or variations in effects like El Nino or La Nina

      <h2><a id="P2">Is the sun causing global warming?</a></h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        No. The sun can influence the Earth's climate, but it isn't responsible for the warming trend we've seen over the past few decades. The sun is a giver of life; it helps keep the planet warm enough for us to survive. We know subtle changes in the Earth's orbit around the sun are responsible for the comings and goings of the ice ages. But the warming we've seen over the last few decades is too rapid to be linked to changes in Earth's orbit, and too large to be caused by solar activity. In fact, recently (2005-2010) the sun has become less active, while temperatures have marched upwards.
        <p>
        One of the "smoking guns" that tells us the sun is not causing global warming comes from looking at the amount of the sun's energy that hits the top of the atmosphere. Since 1978, scientists have been tracking this using sensors on satellites and what they tell us is that there has been no upward trend in the amount of the sun's energy reaching Earth.

        A second smoking gun is that if the sun were responsible for global warming, we would expect to see warming throughout all layers of the atmosphere, from the surface all the way up to the upper atmosphere (stratosphere). But what we actually see is warming at the surface and cooling in the stratosphere. This is consistent with the warming being caused by a build-up of heat-trapping gases near the surface of the Earth, and not by the sun getting "hotter".

        <h2><a id="P3"> Is it too late to prevent climate change?</a></h2>
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, global warming would continue to happen for at least several more decades if not centuries. That's because it takes a while for the planet (for example, the oceans) to respond, and because carbon dioxide - the predominant heat-trapping gas - lingers in the atmosphere for hundreds of years. There is a time lag between what we do and when we feel it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the absence of major action to reduce emissions, global temperature is on track to rise by an average of 6 C (10.8 F), according to the latest estimates. Some scientists argue a "global disaster" is already unfolding at the poles of the planet; the Arctic, for example, may be ice-free in the summer within just a few years. Yet other experts are concerned about Earth passing one or more "tipping points" - abrupt, perhaps irreversible changes that tip our climate into a new state.
